# Recurrent Neural Networks

## 2. RNN Introduction

Hi! I am Ortal, your instructor for this lesson!

In this lesson we will learn about **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.

The neural network architectures you've seen so far were trained using the current inputs only. We did not consider 
previous inputs when generating the current output. In other words, our systems did not have any memory elements. RNNs 
address this very basic and important issue by using **memory** (i.e. past inputs to the network) when producing the 
current output.
