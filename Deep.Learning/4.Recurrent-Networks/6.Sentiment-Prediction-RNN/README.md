# Sentiment Prediction RNN

## 1. Intro

### Sentiment Prediction RNN

Welcome to this lesson on building a recurrent neural network for predicting sentiment. This is intended to give you 
more experience building RNNs. I'm using the dataset from Andrew Trask's lesson, a bunch of movie reviews from IMDB 
labeled with sentiment (positive or negative). You might have also seen a very similar network presented by Siraj. 
Well, this time you get to build it yourself!

I'm going to have you implement this RNN. You can find the notebooks in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning). You can download the 
notebooks from the `sentiment-rnn` folder there, or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
```

If you already have the repo, do a `git pull` to get the new notebooks.

### The Data

The data, `reviews.txt` and `labels.txt`, is located in the `sentiment_network` directory. You can also find the labels [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/sentiment-network/labels.txt) 
and the reviews [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/sentiment-network/reviews.txt).
