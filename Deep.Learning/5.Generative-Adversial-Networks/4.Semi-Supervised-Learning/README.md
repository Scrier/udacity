# Semi-Supervised Learning

## 1. Semi-Supervised Learning

In this lesson, Ian Goodfellow will lead you through implementing a semi-supervised GAN model in TensorFlow. Semi-
supervised models are used when you only have a few labeled data points. These perform surprisingly well even though 
the amount of labeled data you have is relatively tiny.

Here we'll use the SVHN dataset again and attempt to classify the images with a large proportion of the labels dropped.

As a heads up, this material is cutting edge and is more difficult to understand and implement than what you've seen 
before. But, you'll learn a lot and see some really cool results.

### Getting the notebooks
Ian will lead you through a set of notebooks, one where you can try implementing the network and another notebook with 
his solutions. The notebooks are available from our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the `semi-supervised` folder. Either download 
the notebooks from there, or do a `git pull` if you already have the repo.
